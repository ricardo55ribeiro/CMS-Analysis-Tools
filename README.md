# CMS-Analysis-Tools

This repository contains analysis tools and fitting codes developed during research on particle physics within the CMS experiment at the LHC (CERN).

The current implementation focuses on RooFit-based methods for unbinned maximum-likelihood fits to invariant mass spectra of heavy mesons and charmonium states, along with systematic uncertainty evaluations.

All code is written in C++/ROOT and designed for transparency, reproducibility, and educational use.
